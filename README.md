# FileSystemWatcherGUI
The FileSystemWatcher Class monitors the file system and raises events whenever a specified Directory or file within a specified Directory changes. This class can watch for changes within the directory to include sub directories and can monitor directories on a local machine, a network drive, or a remote computer.

For example, each time a new file has been created, the event triggers a popup with the description of the file and the date.
